## 🧠 How It Works

- A secret number between 1 and 20 is randomly generated.
- You start with 20 points.
- After each guess:
  - If it's too high or too low, you lose a point.
  - If you're correct, you win 🎉.
- Your **high score** is saved using `localStorage`.
- Game over when the score reaches 0.
